                    <h3><b>Data Format</b></h3>
                    <p class="doc-title-1">Sensor configuration</p>
                    <p>Each of our four data collection vehicles has one 64-lane LiDAR mounted on top and six 1920x1080 resolution cameras installed to provide 360-degree field of view of the environment.
                        Furthermore, we utilize CARLAâ€™s in-built synchronous mode and our custom code to achieve perfect sensor synchronization in that all camera sensors will only be triggered
                        when the LiDAR scans arrive at the front center of the vehicle.</p>

                    <p class="doc-title-1">Coordinate system</p>
                    <p>We have three types of coordinate systems in the DeepAccident dataset, including the world coordinate, vehicle coordinate and sensor coordinate.
                        For the world and vehicle coordinate, it uses a Z-up left-handed system, with x positive forwards, y positive to the right, and z positive upwards.
                        The sensor coordinates vary with different types of sensors. LiDAR's coordinate directions are consistent with the world and vehicle coordinates.
                        For camera coordinates, x is positive to the right, y is positive downwards, and z is positive forwards.
                        Further, the image coordinate plane is parallel to the camera x-y plane.
                        We provide the intrinsic matrix in the dataset for each camera to enable the projection between the camera coordinate and the image coordinate.
                        To enable the information fusion between different sensors, at each frame, we provide calibrated transformation matrix for each sensor with respect to the vehicle, thus enabling projection between sensors.
                        Moreover, the transformation matrices between each data collection vehicle and the world coordinate are also provided to fuse information between vehicles, thus enabling cooperative autonomous driving.</p>

                    <p class="doc-title-1">Sensor parameter</p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">Lidar</p>
                    <p>The LiDAR sensor emulates the Velodyne HDL-64E LiDAR that has been used in many popular real-world datasets such as KITTI,
                        which has 64 lanes, 120-meter range, [+2\degree, -24.8\degree] vertical field of view, and 10 Hz rotation frequency.</p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">RGB cameras</p>
                    <p>For the six surrounding RGB cameras of each data collection vehicle, they are attached to the left front, front, right front,
                        left rear, rear, right rear part of the vehicle with yaw rotation angles of -45\degree, 0\degree, 45\degree, -135\degree, 180\degree, 135\degree, respectively.
                        The mounting heights for those cameras are all precisely 0.5m above the vehicle center, and each of the cameras has 90\degree~ field of view and 1920 x 1080 resolution,
                        along with some post-processing effects provided in CARLA such as motion blur and light blooming to make the captured images more realistic.
                        Moreover, we capture the camera images with 10 Hz frequency to align with the LiDAR sensor.</p>

                    <p class="doc-title-1">Motion prediction task</p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">Overview</p>
                    <p>We also record the motion of each object in our designed scenarios.
                        The object types are identical to those we use in 3D object detection and tracking.
                        We also provide a coarse object type, which considers cars, vans, and trucks all as vehicles.
                        For the input data of motion prediction, we follow the settings in Waymo motion dataset,
                        which provides the most detailed input information compared to other motion prediction datasets.
                        This includes object motion, HD map information as well as the traffic light state of each driving lane.</p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">Contained information</p>
                    <p>For object motion, at each time step, we record the position, yaw angle, size and velocity of the objects within 100-meter range of the data collection vehicle.
                        For HD map, we provide the map information in a range that ensures the data collection vehicle gets 100-meter range of map at any time step.
                        Each map point contains its position, direction, as well as type.
                        We utilize the road types defined in the CARLA simulator, which has 21 types, including driving, biking, sidewalk, parking, etc.
                        For the traffic light state, at each time step, we provide the traffic light state of each driving lane within 100-meter range of the data collection vehicle.</p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">Input and output time horizon</p>
                    <p>Since the proposed DeepAccident dataset is designed for developing a better algorithm to detect or predict accident scenarios,
                        and accidents normally happen within several seconds, we choose a shorter future period to predict (3 s) than the Waymo motion dataset (8 s).
                        The input time period equals one-second history data plus motion data at the current time step. </p>
                    <p class="doc-title-2">Relation to the perception data in the DeepAccident dataset</p>
                    <p>The motion data part of the DeepAccident dataset uses the same accident reconstruction code to generate scenarios as the perception part.
                        However, since the motion data does not contain any large-size raw sensor data file nor require the time-consuming rendering process in the simulator for LiDAR and RGB camera,
                        we increase the total driving hours to 10 times of the perception data.</p>
